Steven

### Apologies:
Steven was ill.

### Summary of Conversation:
At the start of the Scrum we reviewed our first Sprint and discussed what changes we would make for Sprint 2. We decided to split some of our user stories from the product backlog into smaller pieces of functionality before adding them to our sprint 2 backlog. Then we discussed how many story points we each thought the user stories in the sprint backlog should be assigned. We also decided to use the project and issue features on github to aid communication by showing which user story each member is working on and its status.

## Day 2 - Tuesday 9am - Scrum Meeting Summary
The Scrum Master for this meeting was Cameron

### Members Present:
Cameron, Lachlan, Nicole, Andrew, Cai, Steven

### Summary of Conversation:
At todays scrum meeting we discussed the project so far. We had hit some massive hurdles yesterday, meaning that if we want to continue, some massive changes needed to be made. We have been working on a desktop application, but have now decided that a webapp is the way to go. Because of this, we are planning on spending the day doing some research and getting the project back on track. The issue was with the map integration.
This isnt a start from scratch situation, instead, we are able to salvage most of the back-end code that was already written, the main change is going to be creating a new GUI.

### Members Present:
Cameron, Lachlan, Nicole, Cai, Steven

### Members Not Present:
Andrew

### Apologies:
Andrew was not in the city, he said he would be back this afternoon.

### Summary of Conversation:
After yesterdays change of direction, we went back over the product backlog and ensured that we still had all the stories we needed. Then we went on to the sprint backlog. Here we decided we needed a few more tasks in order to set up the "new" product. The sprint backlog was then used to set up what we were going to be doing for the day. Everyone left the scrum motivated and ready to get this project back on track.
